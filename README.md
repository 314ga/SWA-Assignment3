------ weather-server:
Weather Report Web Service serving fake (random) weather data for Horsens, Aarhus and Copenhagen. It serves three kinds of data: Historic data, forecasts, and warnings (see below). The historical data is generated when the server starts and and will not change unless new data is posted. The forecasts are regenerated periodically (see below). The warnings are generated regularly, independent on other activity and unrelated to other data.
You can run the server by typing the following in the root of the project:
npm start
